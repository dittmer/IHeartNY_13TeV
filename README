IHeartNY_13TeV

13 TeV implementation of code for boosted ttbar differential cross section. Currently designed to run on B2G EDM ntuple files and create slimmed trees for later analysis.

Initial setup:
setenv SCRAM_ARCH slc6_amd64_gcc530 ; ###chs/ tcsh 
export SCRAM_ARCH=slc6_amd64_gcc530 ; ### bash
cmsrel CMSSW_8_0_10_patch2
cd CMSSW_8_0_10_patch2/src
cmsenv

Description of files: 
  PSet.py -- defines input files for standalone running
  iheartny_topxs_fwlite.py -- analysis code to make trees
  execute_*.sh -- commands for standalone running
  crabConfig_*.py -- crab3 config files

To run as standalone:
Modify PSet.py to include files you want to run on (get file names from DAS)
source execute_*.sh

To run using Crab3:
crab submit -c crabConfig_*.py
